## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #3870A4 (RGB) - a refined dental blue that conveys professionalism and trust, moving slightly toward azure in order to avoid cliches of typical dental aesthetics. The choice aligns to the dental industry context and supports a calming, modern design.
- Background color: #F0F2F5 (RGB) - a very light gray for a clean and spacious feel. It provides a subtle contrast, ensuring readability and a focus on the app's content.
- Accent color: #A7E0DD (RGB) - a desaturated teal which introduces a touch of tranquility, in analogy with the blue primary color. Its lower saturation level harmonizes with the main theme while distinguishing interactive elements and highlights.
- Font for Headings: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and professional look.
- Font for UI: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure clear and accessible text. 
- Use simple, professional icons to represent domain availability, save actions, and social handles. Consistent and easily recognizable.
- Clean and whitespace-friendly layout, using a responsive grid (1-column mobile, 2-column tablet, 3-column desktop).
